# Introduction to Data Set

I retrieved the data set from Corgis and it is a e-book sales data set. It contains information about the publisher group, daily average publisher and author revenue, gross sales, book ranking, and genre. The data set doesn't list the name of the book but has a lot of details about its sales and popularity.

# Question

My question is which publishing group pays their authors the best?

I wanted to ask this question because I buy e-books and I was curious to know the revenue that authors are receiving from their book sales and whether the prestige of a publishing groups leads to higher pay for authors.
